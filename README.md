# Rent-a-Car 

This is a university project where I developed a full-stack Rent-a-Car web application from scratch. The project features a React frontend for a dynamic and responsive user interface, an Express (Node.js) backend for handling API requests and server-side logic, and a MongoDB database for storing data.

The application includes full CRUD functionality, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete cars and rental reservations. It showcases integration between frontend and backend, RESTful API design, and basic user interaction flows.
